## 3-player drawing game.

Randomly chosen player (The guesser) tries to guess a word just by looking at what the other 2 players draw (Artists). The first artist starts drawing until he has ink. When his ink finishes the other artist has to continue the same drawing with his own ink.
Artists take turns until the guesser types in the right word.

Created for a 3-day coding marathon.
